How to build a web application capable of interacting with Ethereum smart contracts. This application is and will open up a new world of opportunities for web developers who want to build apps (DAPPS or Decentralize Application) around the blockchain.


In these repositories, we will create a small smart contract to store and retrieve data on the Ethereum blockchain, and we will create a web application that will allow us to access and change the data on the smart contract.
